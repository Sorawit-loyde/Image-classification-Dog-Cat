# Image Classification of Dogs and Cats

This repository utilizes a convolutional neural network to classify images of dogs and cats and recognize which category they belong to. The goal is to achieve high accuracy through various training techniques and optimizations.

## Requirements

- Python version: **3.12.9**  
  Ensure you have Python 3.12.9 installed. 

- TensorFlow:  
  Install TensorFlow for CPU:
  ```bash
  pip install tensorflow==2.12.0
  ```
  Alternatively, if you prefer using a GPU:
  ```bash
  pip install tensorflow-gpu==2.12.0
  ```
